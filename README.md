# Visual Attention Estimation in Drivers
This is the repository for the project of the first module of the course **Electives in AI** held by **Prof. Christian Napoli** at **La Sapienza University of Rome**.
This project is based on this [paper](http://cdn.iiit.ac.in/cdn/cvit.iiit.ac.in/images/Projects/DGAZE/paper.pdf), whose authors also provide this [repository](https://github.com/duaisha/DGAZE). 

## 🔍 Overview
**Drivers' attention is key to road safety!** 🚗. This project aims to estimate where a driver is looking at 👀 and whether they are paying attention to critical elements on the road. We use **Gaze Point Detection** and **Object Detection** to analyze visual focus and determine attentiveness.

We first develop a baseline model, **a CNN-based architecture inspired by GazeCNN**, which takes as input facial features such as eye position, nose position, and head pose to estimate the gaze point.

</p>

And a **larger model** which includes the use of a **Transformer**, specifically a ResNet + Transformer hybrid (GazeTR-Hybrid), which leverages self-attention mechanisms to improve gaze estimation accuracy.

At the end, what we obtain is an **attention score that determines the level of attentiveness, a bounding box for the identified object of focus, and an assessment of whether the driver is paying attention to critical road elements.**

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Gaze Estimation** using **CNN + Transformer** & **ResNet-based models** 🏁🚀  
✅ **Object Detection** using **YOLOv8** to identify key road elements 🚘🚦🚶  
✅ **Attention Scoring** to classify attentiveness 🏎️📍  
✅ **DGaze Dataset Analysis** (3761 image pairs) 📊📷  
✅ **Evaluation against state-of-the-art** methods 🏆📌  

## 🏎️ How It Works
1️⃣ **Gaze Point Detection** 🔭👀  
   - Predicts where the driver is looking using deep learning 🧠📍  
2️⃣ **Object Detection** 🚗🛑  
   - YOLOv8 identifies key objects on the road 🏁🚦  
3️⃣ **Attention Analysis** 🎯  
   - Matches the gaze point with detected objects ✅👀  
   - Classifies attentiveness score (0: Not Attentive ❌, 1: Distracted ❗, 2: Focused ✅)  

## 🔥 Model Performance
📌 **Best Model:** **CNN + Transformer (GazeTR-Hybrid)** 🏆🔬  
📌 **Bounding Box Accuracy:** ~46% 🎯📦  
📌 **Mean Absolute Error:** Competitive with state-of-the-art 🤖📈
